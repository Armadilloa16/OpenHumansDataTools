# OpenHumansDataTools

Tools to work with data downloaded from Open Humans research platform

## Tool #1: Unzip and convert json to csv, and do it on a full batch of downloaded data from OH. 

[Unzip-Rename-OpenHumans-data.sh](https://github.com/danamlewis/OpenHumansDataTools/blob/master/bin/unzip-rename-OpenHumans-data.sh) Note that this tool was designed for use with the OpenAPS and Nightscout Data Commons, which pulls in Nightscout data as json files to Open Humans. Any users will need to adapt the json conversion for the data types they want converted into csv.
